# NeuralLink-Fengru-Cup-Project
This project implements a deep learning-based brainwave UAV cluster control method. By inputting the EEG data set into the deep learning model to classify and generate control instructions, multi-instruction overall control of the UAV cluster is achieved.
In terms of EEG classification, this project proposes a convolutional neural network based on Fourier transform - Time and Frequency Domain Convolutional Neural Network to classify EEG data and generate control instructions, ultimately achieving a five-classification accuracy rate of 88% .
In terms of UAV swarm control, this project uses a UAV swarm attitude adjustment method based on space motion capture.
